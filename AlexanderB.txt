Hello my name is Alex.

Three words that describe me are: persistent, optimistic, and hungry. 

My favorite hobby is basketball. I grew up in the bay so of course my favorite team is the Golden State Warriors but I will admit I think they stacked their team a little too far with KD. I love playing pickup ball and wish there was an app to connect players to make it easier. Maybe I will build it one day?
